# Environment-Semantics-Extraction-Dataset
The dataset is released for the ***vision aided environment semantics extraction*** for wireless communication, such as the beam selection task. The dataset is collected in the V2I communication scenario. The communication environment and vehicles are simulated in CARLA, an autonomous driving simulation platform, and the wireless channel simulation is implemented in Wireless Insite, a ray tracing software. This dataset includes four components: images, locations, effective scatterers and beams.
