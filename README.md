# Environment-Semantics-Extraction-Dataset
The dataset is released for the ***vision aided environment semantics extraction*** for wireless communication, such as the beam selection task. The dataset is collected in the V2I communication scenario. The communication environment and vehicles are simulated in CARLA, an autonomous driving simulation platform, and the wireless channel simulation is implemented in Wireless Insite, a ray tracing software. This dataset includes four components: images, positions, effective scatterers, and beams.

The dataset contains 10 episodes, each corresponding to a unique configuration for traffic flow generation in SUMO, a traffic simulation software. The vehicles move according to the routes and velocities planned by SUMO, generating sequences of images, positions, and information about effective scatterers and beams. For positions, effective scatterers, and beams, the data collected in episode i by vehicle v at frame f is stored in data[i*1000000 + f][v] in the .npy files. For example, the beam information collected in episode 3 by vehicle 18 at frame 2000 can be found in data[3002000][18] in beam_dataset.npy. Meanwhile, the image taken in episode i is stored in ei.zip, where the data collected in by camera c on vehicle v at frame f can be found in ei/v_c/f.png.
